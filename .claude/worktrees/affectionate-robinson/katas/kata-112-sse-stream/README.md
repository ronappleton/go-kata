# Kata 112 — SSE Stream

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata82() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are building: Build `func Kata82() error` as a reliable contract. Focus: real-world Go integration and testing.
- Why this matters in real projects: HTTP boundaries are product behavior. Callers depend on exact semantics.
- How this grows your Go skills: You practice context-aware request handling and stable status/error contracts.
- Definition of done (plain English): A reviewer should be able to confirm this behavior in tests: match the full README contract; include tests for happy path and edge cases; and keep API and error style idiomatic Go.

### Tips
- Pin boundary behavior with `httptest`.
- Cover both success and failure responses.
- Test retries/timeouts with targeted cases.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- Core lesson: treat request/response behavior as a hard contract.
- After this kata, you should be able to justify status/error choices at the service boundary.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
