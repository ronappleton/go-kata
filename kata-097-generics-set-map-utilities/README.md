# Kata 097 — Generics: Set/Map Utilities

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata97() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Generics: Set/Map Utilities` as a reusable, testable abstraction with explicit contracts.
- Why it matters: You will use this when designing packages that need to stay maintainable as features grow.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds API design judgment and composable package structure in Go.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic
