# Go Core 100 Track

This folder defines category-level metadata for the first 100 katas.

Use `track.json` as the source of truth for:

- category names and learning goals
- kata grouping (currently by ranges)
- future expansion (new categories, new tracks)

Category folders live under `categories/` and document category-level learning intent.

The raw kata exercise folders live under the top-level `katas/` directory (`katas/kata-001-*` through `katas/kata-100-*`).
