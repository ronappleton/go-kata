# Starter: Programming Essentials

**Kata range:** `001-010`

## What you are building
You are learning to read a plain requirement and turn it into one clear function contract.

## Why this matters in real Go work
Every service, CLI command, and handler starts with small deterministic functions. If this layer is weak, advanced code becomes fragile.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You can explain expected input/output behavior before coding.
- You handle empty input and boundary cases on purpose.
- You produce stable return values that tests can trust.

## How to practice this category
- Solve one rule at a time and rerun tests often.
- Keep solutions simple and explicit over clever shortcuts.
- Use failures as feedback, then update only one behavior per pass.
