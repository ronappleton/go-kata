# Bug Fix Lab

**Kata range:** `131-135`

## What you are building
You are practicing debugging as a deliberate engineering workflow, not guesswork.

## Why this matters in real Go work
Most real development time is spent diagnosing and correcting existing behavior, not writing greenfield code.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You reproduce bugs consistently before changing code.
- You isolate minimal fixes that satisfy failing behavior contracts.
- You confirm no regressions by rerunning tests after each patch.

## How to practice this category
- Keep tests as the source of truth; fix implementation first.
- Start from the first failing assertion and move one defect at a time.
- Write a short root-cause note for each bug you fix.
