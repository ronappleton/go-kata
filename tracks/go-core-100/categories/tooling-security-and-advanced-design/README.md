# Tooling, Security, and Advanced Design

**Kata range:** `111-130`

## What you are building
You are combining strong implementation skills with production concerns: tooling quality, security, performance, and architecture.

## Why this matters in real Go work
Senior-level Go work is not just code that works. It is code that is safe, operable, testable, and maintainable under change.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You choose tradeoffs consciously and explain them.
- You implement secure defaults and verify failure behavior.
- You design modules that stay understandable as scope grows.

## How to practice this category
- Keep tests and benchmarks close to behavior changes.
- Validate security-sensitive paths first, then optimize.
- Refactor for readability after correctness is proven.
