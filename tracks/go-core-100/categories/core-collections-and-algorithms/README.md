# Core Collections and Algorithms

**Kata range:** `041-050`

## What you are building
You are learning to choose the right data structure and iteration strategy for correctness and clarity.

## Why this matters in real Go work
Production bugs often come from off-by-one logic, ordering mistakes, or incorrect collection handling. This category trains those failure points directly.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You can reason about complexity and still keep code readable.
- You preserve invariants like sorted order and uniqueness when required.
- You can justify algorithm choices with tests and edge-case behavior.

## How to practice this category
- Validate behavior against small and large inputs.
- Add explicit tests for boundaries (first, last, empty, duplicates).
- Keep helper functions small and purpose-driven.
