# Well-Known Packages

**Kata range:** `021-030`

## What you are building
You are learning the standard library packages Go developers use every day, through small behavior-first exercises.

## Why this matters in real Go work
Strong Go engineers rely on the standard library before reaching for third-party dependencies. This category builds package confidence you can reuse across APIs, CLIs, and services.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You can choose the right package for a simple requirement without guessing.
- You can explain package behavior around edge cases and invalid input.
- You can compose package calls while keeping function contracts deterministic.

## How to practice this category
- Read each package docs page before coding the kata.
- Implement one rule at a time and rerun tests often.
- Capture one note per kata: what package behavior surprised you and why.
