# Go Foundations

**Kata range:** `031-040`

## What you are building
You are building fluency with Go control flow, string handling, loops, and function contracts.

## Why this matters in real Go work
These are the mechanics behind nearly every production code path. Correct fundamentals reduce debugging cost later.

## What "correct" looks like by the end
- You can implement behavior from rule text without ambiguity.
- You return stable zero-value behavior when inputs are out of range.
- Your tests document intent, not just pass accidentally.

## How to practice this category
- Start each kata by listing behavior rules in plain English.
- Keep implementation linear and deterministic.
- Refactor only after tests are green.
