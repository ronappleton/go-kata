# Kata 074 — Binary Heap Priority Queue

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata74() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Binary Heap Priority Queue` by holding algorithm invariants and edge cases, not just passing easy examples.
- Why it matters: You will use this when performance matters and correctness must hold at larger input sizes.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds complexity awareness and confidence in proving behavior with tests.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic

## Prior reading
- [Go map types in language spec](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Map_types)
- [Go container/heap package](https://pkg.go.dev/container/heap)
- [Go sort package](https://pkg.go.dev/sort)

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata is focused practice in real-world Go design and testing through `Binary Heap Priority Queue`.
- You will use this when performance matters and correctness must hold at larger input sizes.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
