# Kata 002 — Sum of Integers

**Focus:** Basics: loops, function, edge cases

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Sum(nums []int) int
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Sum of Integers` with clean control flow and reliable edge-case behavior.
- Why it matters: You will use this in everyday Go code where small correctness habits prevent larger defects later.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds the base layer of Go fluency that every advanced kata depends on.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `nil slice => 0`; `empty => 0`; and `works with negatives`.

## Rules / Expectations
- nil slice => 0
- empty => 0
- works with negatives
