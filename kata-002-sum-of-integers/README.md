# Kata 002 — Sum of Integers

**Focus:** Basics: loops, function, edge cases

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Sum(nums []int) int
```

### Learning goal
- Expected work: Implement `Sum of Integers` idiomatically with strong control-flow clarity and edge-case correctness.
- Why: `Sum of Integers` teaches core implementation habits that compound across all later katas.

## Rules / Expectations
- nil slice => 0
- empty => 0
- works with negatives

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata trains basics: loops, function, edge cases by implementing `Sum of Integers` under explicit constraints.
- It is important because `Sum of Integers` strengthens the baseline coding discipline every other kata depends on.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
