- Why it matters: You will use this in everyday Go code where small correctness habits prevent larger defects later.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds the base layer of Go fluency that every advanced kata depends on.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `score 0-100`; `length + variety`; and `simple penalties`.
