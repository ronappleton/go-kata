## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata is about implementing Password Strength Scorer with constraints that make you practice rules.
- It is important because these same tradeoffs appear in production: correctness at boundaries, predictable behavior under edge cases, and maintainable tests.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
