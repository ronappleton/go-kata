# Kata 015 — Merge Two Sorted Lists

**Focus:** Two pointers

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func MergeSorted(a, b []int) []int
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Merge Two Sorted Lists` with clean control flow and reliable edge-case behavior.
- Why it matters: You will use this in everyday Go code where small correctness habits prevent larger defects later.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds the base layer of Go fluency that every advanced kata depends on.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `result sorted`; `handles duplicates`; and `nil treated as empty`.

## Rules / Expectations
- result sorted
- handles duplicates
- nil treated as empty
