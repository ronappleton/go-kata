# Kata 081 — Websocket Chat (basic)

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata81() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Websocket Chat (basic)` as production-style HTTP boundary code with clear request handling and response behavior.
- Why it matters: You will use this in APIs and services where request/response correctness directly affects reliability.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds confidence at service edges: inputs, status codes, retries, and shutdown behavior.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic
