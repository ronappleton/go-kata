# Kata 062 — Context-aware Logger

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata62() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Context-aware Logger` with clean control flow and reliable edge-case behavior.
- Why it matters: You will use this in everyday Go code where small correctness habits prevent larger defects later.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds the base layer of Go fluency that every advanced kata depends on.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata is focused practice in real-world Go design and testing through `Context-aware Logger`.
- You will use this in everyday Go code where small correctness habits prevent larger defects later.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
