# Kata 098 — Generics: Optional/Result

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata98() error
```

### Learning goal
- Expected work: Implement `Generics: Optional/Result` as a composable abstraction with explicit contracts and testable behavior.
- Why: `Generics: Optional/Result` teaches maintainable design through explicit contracts and low coupling.
- When correct: `Generics: Optional/Result` should satisfy the required behavior, including: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic

## Prior reading
- [Go generics tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics)
- [Go: Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- [Go package documentation index](https://pkg.go.dev/std)
- [Go language specification](https://go.dev/ref/spec)

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata trains integration design, boundary handling, and robust testing by implementing `Generics: Optional/Result` under explicit constraints.
- It is important because `Generics: Optional/Result` develops design choices that improve extensibility and testability over time.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
