# Kata 045 — Worker Pool

**Focus:** Concurrency patterns

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func RunPool(ctx context.Context, workers int, jobs <-chan Job) <-chan Result
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Worker Pool` with safe coordination so concurrent work finishes cleanly under load.
- Why it matters: You will use this any time work runs in parallel and must shut down cleanly without races or leaks.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds mental models for goroutines, channels, cancellation, and synchronization.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `cancels on ctx`; `close output when done`; and `no leaks`.

## Rules / Expectations
- cancels on ctx
- close output when done
- no leaks
