# Kata 070 — Password Strength Scorer

**Focus:** Rules

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func PasswordScore(pw string) int
```

### Learning goal
- What you are building: Build `func PasswordScore(pw string) int` as a reliable contract. Focus: Rules.
- Why this matters in real projects: This is everyday Go work: small rules, clear behavior, zero surprises.
- How this grows your Go skills: You practice zero-value handling, explicit branching, and table-driven tests.
- Definition of done (plain English): A reviewer should be able to confirm this behavior in tests: score 0-100; length + variety; and simple penalties.

### Tips
- Write tests from the rules before implementation.
- Name edge cases explicitly: nil, empty, min, max.
- Keep logic linear; branch only when a rule requires it.

## Rules / Expectations
- score 0-100
- length + variety
- simple penalties

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- Core lesson: turn plain rules into deterministic Go behavior.
- After this kata, you should be able to write rule-first tests and explain each edge case clearly.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
