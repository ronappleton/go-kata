# Kata 058 — Simple Pub/Sub

**Focus:** Fanout

## Your task
Implement:

```go
type PubSub struct
```

### Learning goal
- What you are building: Build `Simple Pub/Sub` as a reliable contract. Focus: Fanout.
- Why this matters in real projects: Concurrency bugs are expensive. You are learning to prevent them by design.
- How this grows your Go skills: You practice ownership, cancellation, synchronization, and leak-free shutdown.
- Definition of done (plain English): A reviewer should be able to confirm this behavior in tests: subscribe(topic) chan; publish(topic,msg); and unsubscribe closes chan.

### Tips
- Decide ownership first: who starts, stops, and closes.
- Test cancellation and shutdown before throughput.
- Run `go test -race ./...` regularly.

## Rules / Expectations
- Subscribe(topic) chan
- Publish(topic,msg)
- Unsubscribe closes chan

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- Core lesson: own lifecycle and shutdown before chasing throughput.
- After this kata, you should be able to explain who starts, who stops, and who closes every path.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
