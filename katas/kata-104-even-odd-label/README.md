# Kata 104 — Even Odd Label

**Focus:** Conditionals, modulo arithmetic

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func EvenOddLabel(n int) string
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: translate simple requirements into correct, testable function behavior.
- Why this matters: this is the foundation for every larger Go service, API, and data pipeline you will build later.
- How this grows your Go skills: you build confidence with function contracts, edge cases, and predictable outputs.
- When correct: your function satisfies every rule in the Rules / Expectations section below.

### Tips
- Start from one rule, write one test, then implement only enough code to pass it.
- Keep input handling explicit; do not hide behavior behind clever shortcuts.
- Treat nil/empty and boundary values as first-class cases.

## Rules / Expectations
- n%2==0 => "even"
- n%2!=0 => "odd"
- 0 is treated as even

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- Core lesson: clear thinking first, code second.
- You are training the habit of proving behavior with tests before moving on.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
```
