# Kata 079 — JSON Schema Validator (subset)

**Focus:** Advanced practice

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func Kata79() error
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `JSON Schema Validator (subset)` to transform/parse input strictly, with correct handling of malformed data.
- Why it matters: You will use this at system boundaries where external input must be handled safely and predictably.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds robust boundary validation and deterministic data transformation habits.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `follow README spec`; `write tests`; and `keep it idiomatic`.

## Rules / Expectations
- follow README spec
- write tests
- keep it idiomatic

## What this kata is about (and why it matters)
- This kata is focused practice in real-world Go design and testing through `JSON Schema Validator (subset)`.
- You will use this at system boundaries where external input must be handled safely and predictably.

## What you must submit for marking
- `kata.go`
- `kata_test.go`

## Run
```bash
go test ./...
