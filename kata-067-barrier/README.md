# Kata 067 — Barrier

**Focus:** Concurrency coordination

## Your task
Implement:

```go
func NewBarrier(parties int) (*Barrier, error)
```

### Learning goal
- What you are practicing: Build `Barrier` with safe coordination so concurrent work finishes cleanly under load.
- Why it matters: You will use this any time work runs in parallel and must shut down cleanly without races or leaks.
- How this grows your Go skills: This builds mental models for goroutines, channels, cancellation, and synchronization.
- When correct: When your solution is correct, it should satisfy: `Wait(ctx) error`; `reusable`; and `no leaks`.

## Rules / Expectations
- Wait(ctx) error
- reusable
- no leaks
